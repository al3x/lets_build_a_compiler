h1. Let's Build A Compiler!

h2. Introduction

This an implementation of a simple compiler, built roughly in accordance with a "tutorial by Crenshaw, 1988":http://compilers.iecc.com/crenshaw/. An ASCII copy of the tutorial is included in the 'reference' directory.

Crenshaw implements his compiler in a particular edition of Pascal, long since obsolete. I'll attempt to implement mine in Scala (2.7.7).
